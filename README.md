- **Backend**: Django framework for robust data handling, user management, and API development.
- **Database**: Choose between SQLite (default), PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other Django-supported databases.
- **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for dynamic and static visualizations.
- **GENAI Models**: Integration of state-of-the-art generative AI models for data insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip and virtualenv

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/GENAI-Data-Science-Platform.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd GENAI-Data-Science-Platform
   ```
   
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   
4. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Setup the Django database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Run the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. In a new terminal, launch the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the Django admin and API endpoints.
- Open `http://localhost:8501/` in your browser to interact with the Streamlit application.
- Use the Django admin to manage users, data, and system settings.
- Explore data visualizations, perform analyses, and utilize GENAI features through the Streamlit interface.
